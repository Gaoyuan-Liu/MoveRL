# MoveRL

panda_rl_2 is a Robotic Reinforcement Learning Environment which is compatible with [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) and [Stable-Baseline3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3). On top of that, we integrate benchmark robotic software [Moveit!](https://moveit.ros.org/) to achieve a realistic, safe and efficient RL simulation environment which is easy to be generalized to real-world robots.
